fortnite cheat project. we will finalize this during spring. made this in class cus why not. -  switched from roblox cheats to fortnite, thank you roblox community; its been a great 5 years.

# 5 features ⚙
- headlock/"aim bot" (aim assist): right click to snap onto someones head.

- crosshairs/"mouse graphics": creates graphics around the mouse and/or custom crosshairs too (disable reticle in fortnite settings)

- extreme spray/"intensive shooting": shoots extremely fast (may not ALWAYS work because fortnite has it blocked)

- ping reducer: reduces your ping by little to big amounts. (overall depends on internet connection)

- auto fire????????????

# warnings ⚠
1: ONLY FOR ZERO BUILD (read the **before you download**)

2: DISABLE your crosshair that fortnite provides you (its in settings > UI and Reticle > OFF)

3: if it does NOT appear on screen (to fix go to settings > Windowed Fullscreen)

4: if (in the very rare chance) you get warned or banned by Epic Games **we are NOT responsible for this**!!

# read before installing 😞

**if you are not aware, the default keybinds for editing is Z, X, C, V, and G and a lotta people change it WHICH CREATES a BIG problem. to interact we use these keybinds and now you see thats why this is for zero build. but.... this may or may not apply to you cus when you switch to the app you focus on it and fortnite is just there in the background. anyways ill let you know if this is actually a bug.**

# price 💲
